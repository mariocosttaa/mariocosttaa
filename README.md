## 👨‍💻 About Me

Senior Backend & Fullstack Developer with **over 6 years of experience** delivering custom digital solutions for businesses. I entered the tech world young out of curiosity and a drive to understand how things work—and how to make them better. 

I specialize in building **CRMs, ERPs, SaaS platforms, APIs, dashboards, landing pages, and workflow automations** that streamline operations and increase team efficiency. I stay current with modern engineering practices, continuously testing new tools and technologies to deliver scalable, reliable, and high-performance solutions.
